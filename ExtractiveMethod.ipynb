It is spoken by the Dothraki, a nomadic people in the series\\'s fictional world. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J. Peterson, working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin\\'s novels.\\n\\n, the language comprised 3163 words, not all of which have been made public. In 2012, 146 newborn girls in the United States were named \"Khaleesi\", the Dothraki term for the wife of a \\'\\'khal\\'\\' or ruler, and the title adopted in the series by Daenerys Targaryen.

However, after a few meetings, Djawadi was persuaded to take on the project. The showrunners Benioff and Weiss sent Djawadi the first two episodes of the series, which impressed Djawadi. He arranged a meeting with Benioff and Weiss to discuss the concept of the series, after which he began to compose the music for the series.\\n\\nAccording to Djawadi, Benioff and Weiss were interested in using music to support the different characters and plots.

Benioff and Weiss would also inform Djawadi in advance of the need to expand a theme or create new themes for characters. Djawadi wrote all the music in Santa Monica, California.

Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.\\n\\nFire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition.  Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.\\n\\nModel building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.\\n\\nWhere fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 15}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '8e6b180b21373fedb8cc28fc781c299f'}>,\n",

R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books. Martin was inspired by a couple of events in Scottish history. One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle. A black bull\\'s head, the symbol of death, was served as the last course of the dinner while a single drum was playing in the background, and the Douglases were murdered.

He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.
